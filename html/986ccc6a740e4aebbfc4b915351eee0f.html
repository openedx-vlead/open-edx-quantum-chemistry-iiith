<li>Select the reactants,transition state and the products to get the actual reaction which is under study.</li>
<li>.The inputs of the SN2 reaction i.e., the iodomethane and the chloride ion's input files for GAMESS are considered and upon running GAMESS we get the respective output files i.e., the optimized structures for the inputs of the SN2 reaction.</li>
<li>The TS of the SN2 reaction where the chloride ion and the iodide ion are bound to the methyl group is taken as input and upon running GAMESS the transition state is being found. (the TS state is verified upon looking at one imaginary frequency.)</li>
<li>The output files i.e., the chloromethane and the iodide ion are being optimized using GAMESS.</li>
<li>The energies of the reactants, transition states and the products are being tabulated.</li>
<li>The activation energy(i.e., the difference between the energy of the transition state and that of the reactants) and the reaction energy (i.e., the difference between the energy of the products and that of the reactants) are being calculated.</li>
