<li>Select a molecule (a) Water (b) Ammonia (c) Benzene (d) Formaldehyde (e) Benzene (f) Fullerene(C60).</li>
<li>Fill the atom connectivity to generate the z-matrix for the selected molecule.</li>
<li>The next slide shows the method, basis set and the procedure used for the frequency calculation of the considered molecule under study.</li>
<li>The slide that follows shows the GAMESS input file for the respective molecule.</li>
<li>Upon running GAMESS, the output file for the frequency calculation for the selected molecule is being displayed.</li>
<li>The next slide gives us the normal modes of the respective molecule which is abstracted from the output file for convinience.</li>
<li>Next slide helps us in visualisation of the vibrational frequencies of the selected molecule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat the above steps for every molecule in the list.</p>
