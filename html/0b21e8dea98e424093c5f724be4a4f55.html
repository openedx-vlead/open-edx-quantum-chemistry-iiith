<p>Step by step details of the experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main page choose one of the optimization methods.</li>
<li>Now select one of the displayed molecules for geometric optimization.</li>
<li>In the first stage of optimization, the algorithm is ''constructed'' by clicking on the appropriate buttons at the bottom left of the screen. </li>
<li>In the second stage, the values for various parameters are set:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Choose the position by clicking the "Choose X" and then pointing and clicking on the graph where the point is to be located.</li>
<li>Variables like "Step Size" can be changed within the preset range of values by repeatedly clicking its button.</li>
<li>By clicking the ''Repeat'' button, one iteration is performed. The new position and the structure that corresponds to it are displayed.</li>
</ol>
<li>Please note the value of the minima that you have obtained.</li>
