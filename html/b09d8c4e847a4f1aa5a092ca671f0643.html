<p>From the list of conjugated molecules given:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Select one molecule from the list, to perform the experiment</li>
<li>Identify the atoms involved in conjugation</li>
<li>Identify the number of double bonds involved in conjugation</li>
<li>Fill up the energy levels with the electrons involved in conjugation, and identify the HOMO and LUMO, and hence the transition.</li>
<li>Identify the appropriate formula to determine the length of conjugated part of the molecule using this energy this transition.</li>
<li>From the calculated length of conjugated part, identify the appropriate formula for the&nbsp; calculation of single double bond length</li>
<li>Note the calculated double bond length.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat the above steps for every molecule in the list.</p>
