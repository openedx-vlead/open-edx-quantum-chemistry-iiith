<li>Select the molecule under study and view the z-matrix for the molecule.</li>
<li>The gamess input file will be displayed with the required options like RUNTYP=RSURFACE, IFZMAT=3,7,4,1,8 for the conformational search along the Cl-C-C-Cl dihedral (denoted by 7, 4, 1, 8 atoms in the molecule) angle.</li>
<li>Upon clicking rungamess the output file for the same would be generated which contains the energy at each specified dihedral angle.</li>
<li>The energy thus generated is in Hartrees. Next slide contains a table where the energy values at the specified dihedrals are to be filled in kcal/mol.</li>
<li>By taking these energy and dihedral values, the plot for the energy Vs dihedral looks as shown in the next slide.</li>
<li>Upon clicking on the plot at various dihedrals, the conformation at that particular dihedral is being displayed.</li>
<li>All the conformations for the analysis are being played alongside of the graph to show the various possible conformations.</li>
